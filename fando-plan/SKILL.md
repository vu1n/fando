# Skill: /fando-plan

Automates the workflow of creating a plan, sending it to OpenAI Codex for review, and iterating until the plan is refined. Part of the Fando toolkit - Claude and Codex working together as the "odd couple" of AI-assisted development.

## Trigger

User runs `/fando-plan [--security=<level>] <task description>`

**Options:**
- `--security=personal` - Minimal security review (side projects)
- `--security=internal` - Standard security (internal tools)
- `--security=public` - Strict security (customer-facing) [default]
- `--security=enterprise` - Maximum security (regulated/compliance)

## Autonomous Iteration (Ralph-style)

**IMPORTANT**: This skill uses autonomous iteration. Once the user consents to start, Claude should:

1. **Iterate automatically** - Do NOT ask for user input between iterations
2. **Keep looping** - Continue refining the plan until a stop condition is met
3. **Show progress** - Display each iteration's feedback and plan updates as you go
4. **Only pause when necessary** - See stop conditions below

This follows the "Ralph method" philosophy: iterate continuously, accept imperfection, refine until done.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Consent & Initialization

1. **Check Codex CLI availability:**
   ```bash
   codex --version
   ```
   If not installed, inform user: "Codex CLI not found. Install from https://github.com/openai/codex"

2. **Create initial plan** for the user's task using standard planning approach

3. **Scan for secrets** before proceeding:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/.claude/skills/fando-plan/scripts/secrets.py --mode=check <<< "$PLAN"
   ```
   - If secrets found, show warning and offer options:
     - [Redact and proceed] - mask secrets before sending
     - [Cancel] - abort the review
     - [I understand, send anyway] - proceed with secrets (user acknowledges risk)

4. **Detect or confirm security level:**
   ```bash
   python3 ~/.claude/skills/fando-plan/scripts/detect_security_level.py <<< "$PLAN"
   ```

   - If `--security=X` flag provided: use that level
   - If auto-detected with high confidence (>0.7): use detected level
   - Otherwise: show detected level and ask user to confirm:
     ```
     Detected security level: internal (matched: "admin dashboard", "employee")

     Options:
     1. Yes, use internal
     2. Change to: personal / public / enterprise
     ```

   Display the level being used:
   ```
   Security level: internal
   └─ Auth issues flagged, compliance checks skipped
   ```

5. **Show consent prompt:**
   ```
   This will send your plan to Codex for review.

   - The plan will be sent to OpenAI's Codex API
   - A copy will be saved to ~/.claude/plan-reviews/

   Options:
   1. Yes, proceed
   2. No, cancel
   3. Yes, but don't log
   ```
   Only proceed if user consents.

### Phase 2: Parallel Specialist Reviews (NEW)

After initial plan creation, run specialized reviewers in parallel for domain-specific feedback.

#### 2.1 Detect Relevant Profiles

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/fando-plan/scripts/detect_profiles.py <<< "$PLAN"
```

Returns profiles based on plan content (e.g., `["security", "frontend", "api"]`).

**Available Profiles:**

| Profile | Trigger Keywords | Focus Areas |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Security** | auth, password, token, jwt, encrypt, secret, permission, role | Auth, authz, input validation, secrets, OWASP |
| **Frontend** | react, vue, component, css, ui, ux, form, modal, state, hook | Components, state, accessibility, UX patterns |
| **Data** | database, schema, migration, query, sql, table, index, postgres | Schema design, queries, indexes, consistency |
| **API** | endpoint, rest, graphql, route, request, response, http, webhook | Contract design, versioning, error handling |
| **DevOps** | deploy, ci/cd, docker, k8s, pipeline, terraform, aws, monitoring | Infrastructure, deployment, observability |
| **Performance** | cache, optimize, latency, throughput, scale, load, memory | Bottlenecks, caching, optimization strategies |

#### 2.2 Display Selected Reviewers

```
Detected plan components: authentication, React UI, REST endpoints

Running specialist reviewers in parallel:
  ├─ Security Reviewer
  ├─ Frontend Architect
  └─ API Designer
```

#### 2.3 Parallel-then-Merge Iteration Loop (max 5 iterations)

**FOR EACH ITERATION:**

1. **Run ALL selected reviewers in parallel:**
   ```bash
   python3 ~/.claude/skills/fando-plan/scripts/run_parallel_reviews.py \
     --security-level=$SECURITY_LEVEL \
     security frontend api <<< "$PLAN"
   ```

2. **Aggregate findings from all reviewers:**
   ```bash
   python3 ~/.claude/skills/fando-plan/scripts/aggregate_findings.py <<< "$PARALLEL_RESULTS"
   ```

3. **Display findings grouped by reviewer:**
   ```
   ━━━ Iteration 1/5 Findings ━━━

   Security Reviewer:
   - [HIGH] Missing CSRF protection on auth endpoints
   - [MEDIUM] JWT expiry too long (24h → recommend 1h)

   Frontend Architect:
   - [MEDIUM] No loading states defined for async operations

   API Designer:
   - [MEDIUM] Missing rate limiting on public endpoints

   ⚠️  Potential Conflict Detected:
   - Security: "Strict rate limit 10/min"
   - Performance: "Rate limit too aggressive"
   💡 Will resolve in architect review
   ```

4. **Claude updates plan ONCE to address ALL findings**

5. **Check stop conditions:**

   | Condition | Action |
   |-----------|--------|
   | 0 HIGH + 0 MEDIUM from all reviewers | **Stop** - proceed to Phase 2.4 (Architect Review) |
   | HIGH or MEDIUM findings remain | **Continue** - loop back to step 1 |
   | Same findings repeated 2x | **Stop** - surface to user |
   | 5 iterations reached | **Stop** - proceed to architect with remaining issues |

6. **Track what was addressed:**
   ```
   ━━━ Iteration 1 → 2 Changes ━━━
   ✓ [ADDRESSED] CSRF protection → Added to auth middleware spec
   ✓ [ADDRESSED] JWT expiry → Changed to 1h with refresh tokens
   ✓ [ADDRESSED] Loading states → Added UX section with states
   ✓ [ADDRESSED] Rate limiting → Added to API spec
   ```

#### 2.4 Final Systems Architect Review

After all specialists are satisfied (0 HIGH/MEDIUM findings):

1. **Run architect final pass:**
   ```bash
   python3 ~/.claude/skills/fando-plan/scripts/call_codex.py \
     "$(cat ~/.claude/skills/fando-plan/references/profiles/architect.md)" <<< "$PLAN"
   ```

2. **Architect reviews:**
   - Complete aggregated plan
   - Conflicts between specialist recommendations
   - Cross-cutting concerns
   - Overall coherence

3. **If conflicts detected, resolve them:**
   ```
   ⚠️  Conflict Detected:
   - Security: "Strict rate limit 10/min"
   - Performance: "Rate limit too aggressive for expected load"

   Architect Resolution: "Use 30/min with burst allowance of 50"
   ```

4. **Final LGTM or one more iteration**

### Phase 2 (Legacy): Single Reviewer Loop

**Note:** The legacy single-reviewer loop is still available for simpler plans or when specialist profiles aren't detected.

**Loop automatically without user input.** For each iteration:

1. **Build the review prompt** with:
   - Current plan (inline)
   - Previous feedback summary (last 2-3 iterations)
   - Risk-level classification instructions

2. **Call Codex for review:**
   ```bash
   python3 ~/.claude/skills/fando-plan/scripts/call_codex.py "$REVIEW_PROMPT" <<< "$PLAN"
   ```

3. **Parse the response:**
   ```bash
   python3 ~/.claude/skills/fando-plan/scripts/parse_findings.py <<< "$CODEX_RESPONSE"
   ```

4. **Display iteration results** to user (but do NOT wait for input):
   ```
   Iteration 2/5 - Codex feedback:
   - [HIGH] Missing error handling for network failures
   - [MEDIUM] Consider rate limiting

   Addressing feedback...
   ```

5. **Check stop conditions:**

   | Condition | Action |
   |-----------|--------|
   | LGTM or 0 HIGH + 0 MEDIUM | **Stop** - plan approved, proceed to Phase 3 |
   | HIGH or MEDIUM findings | **Continue automatically** - update plan and loop |
   | Only LOW/NITPICK remaining | **Stop** - plan approved (minor issues noted) |
   | Same HIGH/MEDIUM repeated 2x | **Stop** - Codex is stuck, surface to user |
   | 5 iterations reached | **Stop** - ask user if they want to continue |

6. **If continuing:** Update the plan to address feedback, then **immediately loop back to step 1**

### Phase 3: Documentation

If user consented to logging:

1. Get project name:
   ```bash
   git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*\///' | sed 's/\.git$//' || basename "$(pwd)"
   ```

2. Save documentation to:
   ```
   ~/.claude/plan-reviews/{project-name}/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{task-slug}.md
   ```

3. Include:
   - Original task
   - Each iteration's plan version
   - Each iteration's Codex feedback
   - How feedback was addressed
   - Final approved plan
   - Key learnings

## Review Prompt Template

Use the prompts from `references/review_prompts.md`:
- **Initial review**: Full architectural review
- **Iteration review**: Focus on whether previous concerns were addressed

## Output Format

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Codex CLI not found | Show installation instructions |
| Codex timeout (>10min) | Retry once, then ask user |
| Codex returns error | Show error, ask user how to proceed |
| Parsing fails | Show raw response, continue with manual review |
| Secrets detected | Block by default, offer redact option |

## Configuration

- **Max iterations**: 5 (configurable)
- **Timeout**: 10 minutes per Codex call
- **Min Codex version**: v0.85.0
- **Matryoshka threshold**: 300 lines (configurable)

## Matryoshka Token Optimization

For large plans (300+ lines), fando-plan uses **Matryoshka MCP** to achieve 75%+ token savings when sending plans to multiple reviewers.

### How It Works

Instead of sending the full plan (3000+ tokens) to each of 6 reviewers:
1. Plan is loaded into Matryoshka once
2. Domain-specific slices are extracted per reviewer:
   - Security reviewer gets auth/security sections only (~400 tokens)
   - Frontend reviewer gets component/UI sections only (~500 tokens)
   - etc.

**Before Matryoshka**: 6 reviewers × 3000 tokens = 18,000 tokens/iteration
**After Matryoshka**: ~2,500 tokens total/iteration (83% savings)

### Activation

Matryoshka mode activates automatically when:
- Plan exceeds 300 lines (configurable via `--matryoshka-threshold`)
- Matryoshka MCP server is available

### Display

When Matryoshka is active, output shows token efficiency:
```
━━━ Token Efficiency ━━━
Token efficiency: 1,324 tokens sent (vs. 7,623 without slicing)
Savings: 83%
Profiles sliced: 5, fallback: 1
```

### Fallback Behavior

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Plan < 300 lines | Skip Matryoshka, direct mode |
| MCP unavailable | Graceful fallback to full plan |
| Query returns empty | Use full plan for that profile |
| Slice too small (<50 tokens) | Use full plan for that profile |
| Session close fails | Log warning, continue |

### Setup

Run the setup script to configure Matryoshka MCP:
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

To disable Matryoshka for a run:
```bash
python3 run_parallel_reviews.py --no-matryoshka security frontend api <<< "$PLAN"
```
