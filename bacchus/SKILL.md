# Bacchus - Worktree-Based Agent Coordination

Lightweight coordination for parallel agent work. Uses git worktrees for isolation and integrates with beads for task management.

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vu1n/bacchus/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

## Core Workflow

```
next → work in worktree → release
```

### 1. Get Work

```bash
bacchus next agent-1
```

This command:
- Queries beads DB for ready tasks (open, no blockers)
- Creates isolated worktree at `.bacchus/worktrees/{bead_id}/`
- Claims the bead, updates status to `in_progress`

Output:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bead_id": "PROJ-42",
  "title": "Implement user auth",
  "worktree_path": ".bacchus/worktrees/PROJ-42",
  "branch": "bacchus/PROJ-42"
}
```

### 2. Do Work

Work in the worktree directory. All changes are isolated on branch `bacchus/{bead_id}`.

```bash
cd .bacchus/worktrees/PROJ-42
# make changes, commit normally
git add . && git commit -m "Implement auth"
```

### 3. Release

```bash
# Success - merge to main, cleanup worktree, close bead
bacchus release PROJ-42 --status done

# Blocked - keep worktree for later, mark bead blocked
bacchus release PROJ-42 --status blocked

# Failed - discard changes, reset bead to open
bacchus release PROJ-42 --status failed
```

## Stale Detection

Find and cleanup abandoned claims:

```bash
# List stale claims (>30 min old)
bacchus stale --minutes 30

# Auto-cleanup: remove worktrees, reset beads to open
bacchus stale --minutes 30 --cleanup
```

## List Active Claims

See all active claims and worktrees:

```bash
bacchus list
```

Output:
```json
{
  "claims": [
    {
      "bead_id": "PROJ-42",
      "agent_id": "agent-1",
      "worktree_path": ".bacchus/worktrees/PROJ-42",
      "branch_name": "bacchus/PROJ-42",
      "age_minutes": 5
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

## Code Search

Index and search symbols:

```bash
# Index a directory
bacchus index src/

# Search for symbols
bacchus symbols --pattern "User*" --kind class
bacchus symbols --file "src/auth.ts"
```

## Status

```bash
bacchus status
```

Shows active claims, worktree locations, and indexed symbol count.

## Relationship to Beads

```
beads    → What work needs to be done (issues, deps, status)
bacchus  → Who's doing what right now (claims, worktrees)
```

Bacchus reads from beads to find ready work and updates bead status on claim/release. Use beads for any workflow. Add bacchus when multiple agents work in parallel to ensure isolation via worktrees.

## Merge Conflict Handling

When `release --status done` encounters a conflict:

```bash
# Option 1: Resolve manually, then complete
# (fix conflicts in files, git add them)
bacchus resolve PROJ-42

# Option 2: Abort merge, keep working
bacchus abort PROJ-42

# Option 3: Discard all work
bacchus release PROJ-42 --status failed
```

## Orchestrator Pattern

Main agent has broad context (project overview, all tasks). Sub-agents have focused context (single task + worktree).

### Using Claude Code Task Tool (Primary)

1. **Claim task**:
   ```bash
   bacchus next worker-1
   # Returns: { bead_id, title, description, worktree_path }
   ```

2. **Spawn sub-agent**:
   ```
   Task tool:
     subagent_type: "general-purpose"
     prompt: |
       Work in {worktree_path} on task {bead_id}: {title}

       {description}

       Commit changes when done.
     run_in_background: true
   ```

3. **Monitor**: `TaskOutput(task_id)`

4. **Release**: `bacchus release {bead_id} --status done|failed`

5. **Repeat** as needed - scale up/down based on workload

### Why Sequential Claiming Works

```
bacchus next worker-1  → claims BEAD-1, marks in_progress
bacchus next worker-2  → BEAD-1 taken, gets BEAD-2
bacchus next worker-3  → BEAD-1,2 taken, gets BEAD-3
```

No race conditions. Each `next` call atomically claims the highest-priority ready bead.

### Using Terminal Multiplexer (Human Monitoring)

For visual debugging with zellij or tmux:

```bash
# Each pane runs an isolated agent
zellij run -- claude --print "Work on BEAD-1 in .bacchus/worktrees/BEAD-1"
zellij run -- claude --print "Work on BEAD-2 in .bacchus/worktrees/BEAD-2"
```

Each pane shows real-time agent output. Useful for debugging but main agent can't easily read structured results.

## Directory Structure

```
